The directory utility contains a lot of commands, including
directory, copy, mount, diff, search, type.
Just do a cp directory to whatever of the other utilities, like
cp directory mount.

Make sure . is first in PATH, and stand in the same dir as the binaries.

Do "mount ods2image" (or ods2image2)
Now directory etc can be used like "directory ods2image2:".
