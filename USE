Current as of FreeVMS 0.2.6.
	Warning: there may be some more unstability compared to 0.2.3
	due to changes in AST system and modes to resemble VMS more.
	IPACP is now working on i386 again, and partially on x86_64.
	Do not expect much of the x86_64 version; I can not even
	guarantee it will not catch fire. Basic boot on DCL Ext2. (First.)

Bochsrc FreeVMS-related config:
	floppya: 1_44=a.img, status=inserted
	ata0-master: type=disk, path=c.img, cylinders=8, heads=255, spt=63
	boot: a
	Skip ne2k if you just downloaded and tried the image.
	ne2k: ioaddr=0x280, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=linux, ethdev=eth0 (on c.img, on c2.img it must be different) 

	ips: must be properly set to work. test yourself.

Qemu use:
	qemu -fda diskimage/a.img -hda diskimage/c.img -boot a -monitor stdio

The default is DCL for CONFIG_VMS mode.

When booting bochs, there are mainly 4 usable choices:
 x freevms.iomm.dcl                                                        x
 x freevms.iomm.default                                                    x
 x freevms.iomm.ods2.dcl                                                   x
 x freevms.iomm.ods2.default                                               x

The ODS-2 named are of course with ODS-2, and the rest with ext2 root.
The DCL choice jumps straight into DCL (just as if you had a conversational
boot, set startup_p1 "min" and set /startup opa0:), the default does
a subset of startup, and you have to press a key to get a DCL CLI.

When ext2 root / is mounted under RMS, it is possible to do type [etc]group.

running commands:
	DCL: typically command
	/bin/sh: /vms\$common/sysexe/command (only for non-CONFIG_VMS,
		and if starting commands this way is still supported)
	note: abbreviation may or may not work

General utilities:

DCL:
	if not too much crashed, it can be rebooted with ctrl-p
	Ctrl-D/E/F/H and backspace also works.

RUN/MCR:
	use them as "usual"
	no qualifiers
	do not run .ele files in CONFIG_VMS mode.
	
Set symbol:
	sym = val

DELETE:
	file or symbol
	qualifier /symbol

DIRECTORY:
	directory
	qualifiers: /file /size /date
	should only be used with ODS-2.

CREATE /DIRECTORY:
	create /directory name
	Use plain name without [], in directory where it is to be created
	ODS-2 and non-CONFIG_VMS only.

COPY:
	copy/import/export

DIFFERENCE/SEARCH/TYPE:
	as is, no qualifiers

SET PROCESS:
	qualifiers: /name /priority

SET PROMPT:
	set prompt string OR set prompt

SET DEFAULT:
	set default pathname

SHOW DEFAULT:
	show default	

SHOW DEVICES:
	at current only shows drivers
	show devices
	386 ide devices partitions show up as dqa0 etc. (hdb2 -> dqb2 etc)

SHOW MEMORY:
	show memory

SHOW SYSTEM:
	show system

SHOW SYMBOL:
	show symbol sym

SHOW TIME:
	show time

STOP:
	It can now be given hexadecimal numbers 
	It must be used with VMS PIDs if to be used         
	in a cluster (the Unix pids can be used on the local node).
	(Stop on cluster works again)

	stop /id=proc
	stop name

DEFINE:
	define /table table logical equivalence

CREATE /NAME_TABLE
	create /name_table /parent_table parent name
	create /name_table name

SHOW LOGICAL:
	show logical /table table logical

SHOW WORKING_SET:
	show working_set

SET WORKING_SET:
	adds or subtracts to working set quota
	does not work exactly to specs
	set working_set /quota=delta
	set working_set /extent=delta

Networking:

CMUIP:
	Skip this if you just downloaded and tried the image.
	see example file INET$CONFIG.
	DEVICE_INIT:ETHER:era0:00-00-00-00-00-00:192.168.0.42:255.255.0.0
	VARIABLE:TELNET_SERVICE:1
	GATEWAY:gateway.com:192.168.0.1:0.0.0.0:0.0.0.0

Telnet:
	Start with telnet.
	do connect ipv4-address.
	it is possible to telnet to another FreeVMS node, no other.
	When using the local CMUIP telnet client, there is now more
	negotiations, and this may trigger errors due to missing
	initializations in the original code.

System administration utilities:

ANALYZE /SYSTEM:
	has show device and exit

AUTHORIZE:
	run sys$system:authorize
	show user
	does not return to DCL

INSTALL:
	install add/priv=(list) file

MOUNT:
	Local ODS2 image
	Go to image directory
	Mount dqa2 (if using ext2 root).

	Mount file (not partition) (option is not recently tested).
	Must be a file in /. 

	Cluster mount
	The other file image must be mounted
	mount other$dfa0
	Then use as dir other$dfa0 etc

INIT: 
	From shell on compiler box (no DCL): init filename volume-name size 

DFU:
	dfu (run from bash)
	commands: verify dfa0, exit; non CONFIG_VMS mode

******************************

Clustering:
Do not use this now, wait until we get a new network engine.
Now works with CONFIG_VMS (without, there are problems with timer queue?).
You need to have the nodename in params.dat.
The two first letters in the nodename must be different.
Also, the name must be max (or exactly) 4 letters.
Clustering starts automatically.
Within 10 secs, you will see a "scs received hello"
After 10 secs, you will see starting cluster connects and some CON_RSPs.
Later you may see something about probing and MSCP units.
Wait until you see these kernel messages.
Currently "disabled" due to new CONFIGURE: Then you can do mount other$dfa0 etc.

config file:
	/vms\$common/sysexe/params.dat must have
	SCSNODE=name
	SCSDEVICE=eua0
	(or whatever device it is)
	This replaces/will replace the use of hostname for clustering

******************************

Outdated, as working uml is dead:

starting uml example:
	./linux debug eth0=mcast ubd0=../../uml/root_fs mem=16M init=/vms\$common/sysexe/dcl

UML ubd devices show up as daa0 etc.

starting uml example:
	./linux debug eth0=mcast ubd0=../../uml/root_fs mem=16M init=[vms\$common.sysexe]dcl
	./linux debug eth0=mcast ubd0=../../uml/root_fs mem=16M init=[bin]sh
