starting uml example:
	./linux debug eth0=mcast ubd0=../../uml/root_fs mem=16M init=/vms\$common/sysexe/dcl

config file:
	/vms\$common/sysexe/params.dat must have
	SCSNODE=name
	SCSDEVICE=eua0
	(or whatever device it is)
	This replaces/will replace the use of hostname for clustering

running commands:
	DCL: typically command
	/bin/sh: /vms\$common/sysexe/command
	note: abbreviation may not work

RUN/MCR:
	use them as "usual"
	no qualifiers
	DCL only.
	
MOUNT:
	Local file ODS2 image
	Go to image directory
	mount filename

	Cluster mount
	The other file image must be mounted
	mount other$dfa0
	Then use as dir other$dfa0 etc

INIT: 
	init filename volume-name size

DIRECTORY:
	directory
	qualifiers: /file /size /date

COPY:
	copy/import/export

DIFFERENCE/SEARCH/TYPE:
	as is, no qualifiers

SET PROCESS:
	has some problems for now?
	DCL only

SET PROMPT:
	set prompt string OR set prompt
	DCL only

SET DEFAULT:
	does only a chdir (directory know nothing about this)
	set default pathname
	DCL only

SHOW DEFAULT:
	show default	
	DCL only

SHOW DEVICES:
	at current only shows drivers
	show devices
	DCL only

SHOW SYSTEM:
	show system
	DCL only

SHOW TIME:
	show time
	DCL only

STOP:
	It can now be given hexadecimal numbers 
	It must be used with VMS PIDs if to be used         
	in a cluster (the Unix pids can be used on the local node).
	(Stop on cluster works again)

	stop /id proc
	stop
	DCL only (unless you use /vms\$common/syshlp/examples/forcex)

DEFINE:
	define /table table logical equivalence
	DCL only

CREATE /NAME_TABLE
	create /name_table /parent_table parent name
	create /name_table name
	DCL only

SHOW LOGICAL:
	show logical /table table logical
	DCL only

DFU:
	dfu

******************************

Clustering:
Now works with CONFIG_VMS (without, there are problems with timer queue?).
You need to have the nodename in params.dat.
The two first letters in the nodename must be different.
Also, the name must be max (or exactly) 4 letters.
Clustering starts automatically.
Within 10 secs, you will see a "scs received hello"
After 10 secs, you will see starting cluster connects and some CON_RSPs.
Later you may see something about probing and MSCP units.
Wait until you see these kernel messages.
Currently "disabled" due to new CONFIGURE: Then you can do mount other$dfa0 etc.

******************************

Only for CONFIG_VMS:

UML ubd devices show up as daa0 etc.
386 ide devices partitions show up as dqa0 etc. (hdb2 -> dqb2 etc)
Ext2 root / is mounted under RMS, and it is possible to do dir [etc] etc.
It is possible to do type [etc]group

starting uml example:
	./linux debug eth0=mcast ubd0=../../uml/root_fs mem=16M init=[vms\$common.sysexe]dcl
	./linux debug eth0=mcast ubd0=../../uml/root_fs mem=16M init=[bin]sh

MOUNT:
	can mount daa0 and dqa0

SHOW WORKING_SET:
	show working_set
	DCL only

SET WORKING_SET:
	adds or subtracts to working set quota
	does not work exactly to specs
	set working_set /quota delta
	set working_set /extent delta
	DCL only

run a VMS image file:
	do mcr/run on a file with name.exe

DCL:
	if not too much crashed, it can be rebooted with ctrl-p
	exe images are now the default with commands
	old fork/exec commands can be run with _ prefixed.

CMUIP:
	see example file INET$CONFIG.

******************************

NOTES/bugs general:

ODS2 write-support seems to have gotten some problems.
Do not expect DECnet to work (collides with cluster code)
Logicals only can be used with show logical, define and create /name_table;
nowhere else yet. (And only without nesting.)

******************************

NOTES/bugs CONFIG_VMS:

A more experimental config; do not boot to more than /bin/sh or DCL.
Write support on ext2 has some (minor?) bugs or faults or shortcomings.
RMS dir can not be done on ext2 root /.
/bin/sh and other shellscripting does not work.
