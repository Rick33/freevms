For when features were tested, see TESTING.

Current as of FreeVMS 0.3.

Qemu use:
	qemu -fda diskimage/a.img -hda diskimage/c.img -boot a -monitor stdio -net none 

The default is DCL for FreeVMS.

When booting bochs, there are mainly 2 usable choices:
  freevms.dcl
  freevms.default

The ODS-2 named are of course with ODS-2, and the rest with ext2 root.
The DCL choice jumps straight into DCL (just as if you had a conversational
boot, set startup_p1 "min" and set /startup opa0:), the default does
a subset of startup, and you have to press a key to get a DCL CLI.

When ext2 root / is mounted under RMS, it is possible to do type [etc]group.

running commands:
	DCL: typically command
	/bin/sh: /vms\$common/sysexe/command (may not work anymore,
		and if starting commands this way is still supported)
	note: abbreviation may or may not work

General utilities:

DCL:
	if not too much crashed, it can be rebooted with ctrl-p
	Ctrl-D/E/F/H and backspace also works.

	sym = val
