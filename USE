For when features were tested, see TESTING.

Current as of FreeVMS 0.3.

Qemu use:
	qemu -fda diskimage/a.img -hda diskimage/c.img -boot a -monitor stdio -net none 
	(qemu-system-i386/qemu-system-x86_64)

When booting bochs, there are mainly 2 usable choices:
  freevms.ext2.dcl
  freevms.ext2.default

The DCL choice jumps straight into DCL (just as if you had a conversational
boot, set startup_p1 "min" and set /startup opa0:), the default does
a subset of startup, and you have to press a key to get a DCL CLI.

Note for Ext2, do not use any write on Ext2 file system.

	DCL: typically command
