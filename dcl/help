HELP

   The   HELP   command   invokes   the  HELP  Facility  to  display
   information about a command or topic.  In response to the "Topic?"
   prompt, you can:

      o Type  the  name of the command  or topic for which you need help.

      o Type  INSTRUCTIONS  for more detailed  instructions on how to use
        HELP.

      o Type  HINTS  if you are not  sure of the  name  of the command or
        topic for which you need help.

      o Type HELP/MESSAGE for help with the HELP/MESSAGE command.

      o Type a question mark (?) to redisplay the most recently requested
        text.

      o Press the Return key one or more times to exit from HELP.

   You  can  abbreviate any  topic name, although ambiguous abbreviations
   result in all matches being displayed.
