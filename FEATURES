The following features are present, from partially to fully implemented.

Supported hardware configuration:
	Console: VGA
	Network interfaces: ne2k and ne2k-pci
			    3c900 (3c905/3c590 might work, untested)
	Disk interface: IDE

Core kernel features:
	Control mechanisms: Software interrupts, ASTs
	Synchronization: Event flags, locks
	Scheduling, time support, process control and communication
	Memory management: Working set list, swapper, pools
	Input/output: QIO, mailboxes, terminal driver
	Image support: VMS Images and ELF
	Miscellaneous: Logical names

File system:
	RMS read/write SEQ (yes) IDX (too little to be usable)
	RMS can be run on both ODS-2 and Ext2 (but less functionality on Ext2)
	ODS-2 read/write/execute
	ODS-5 readonly 
	ODS-2 initialize
	DFU doing analyze/disk
	XQP (for ODS-2, and something like it for Ext2)
	ODS-2 can have bootable kernel and user environment

Bootloader:
	GRUB with ODS-2 support to boot kernel

Clustering:
	SCA/SCS-ish protocols
	CONFIGURE process
	CWPS (forcex/stop only)
	MSCP (does not currently work due to lost network packets)

Networking:
	CMUIP (can now do both outgoing and ingoing TCP/IP)
	Telnet client

Shell:
	DCL
		Mcr, run
		Simple @ scripts
		Basis CLD and CLI$ support
		Simple symbol support
	DCL builtin
		define, goto, logout, stop, exit
		set default/prompt/process
		show default/time
	DCL utilities
		copy, delete, directory, edt, init, mount, search, type
		create /name_table
		set working_set
		show device/system/logical/working_set

Editor:
	EDT (from Ozone, and can not yet be used fully)

Programming language:
	Bliss (is under development)

Linker:
	LINKER (simple, static images. Can do some dynamic linking.)

RTL:
	STR$
	LIB$

Misc utilities:
	Backup
	CDU (mainly parses a CLD file)
	MSG (generates numbers only)
	Authorize (with show only)
	Install (with add only)
	Analyze/system (wit show dev only)
