So far:

Due to use of anynymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
You might need gcc "2.96" from recent RedHat; someone may have had success with
gcc 3.x.
Redhat 7.2 with gcc "2.96" works. There are anonymous structure offset bugs
that has been coded around.
Redhat 8.0 with gcc 3.2 (RedHat patched) works. The anonymous structure offset
bugs present in pure gcc 3.0.1 was gone in pure 3.1.

Untar the linux dist in /usr/src or some other place.

Untar freevms in the same directory (or symlink from there to the real place)

Go to the linux directory.

Do ../freevms/linux/prescript. (Links from working area ../freevms/linux)

If having user mode linux, patch in now, and do ../freevms/linux/prescript.uml.
(We are based on uml-patch-2.4.18-11, use -p1 -F 100 and such)

Make symlinks from the 'kernel directory'/include/linux to /usr/include/linux
and the same with asm-i386 to /usr/include/asm.

Go to /usr/src/freevms and do a make (if uml, see Makefiles for how to compile)
(Sorry, got no make install yet)

Go back and make the kernel.
