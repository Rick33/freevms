So far:

Due to use of anynymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
You might need gcc "2.96" from recent RedHat; someone may have had success with
gcc 3.x.
Redhat 7.2 with gcc "2.96" works. There are anonymous structure offset bugs
that has been coded around.
Redhat 8.0 with gcc 3.2 (RedHat patched) works. The anonymous structure offset
bugs present in pure gcc 3.0.1 was gone in pure 3.1.

Untar the linux dist in /usr/src or some other place.

Untar freevms in the same directory (or symlink from there to the real place)

Go to the linux directory.

Do ../freevms/linux/prescript. (Links from working area ../freevms/linux)

If having user mode linux, patch in now, and do ../freevms/linux/prescript.uml.
(We are based on uml-patch-2.4.18-11, use -p1 -F 100 and such)

Go to /usr/src/freevms and do a make and make install (if uml, see Makefiles for how to compile). Then copy the resulting files from root/.
(Sorry, got no make install yet)

UserMode Linux needs the symlinks from /usr/include/{asm,linux}
to the kernel build place.

Go back and make the kernel.

NOTE:
See BUGS regarding uml

NOTE on kernel config with VMS options:
There is only one option, CONFIG_VMS (replaces and includes CONFIG_VMS_IO/MM)
Warning: It might be a risky destructive option.
VMS IO works so far only on blockdevices, and the only blockdevices supported
is the uml "harddisk" and on i386 only ide (may not work with all blocksizes).
Boot with init=/bin/sh.
Note that with some kernel options it might not compile, so in case strip away some configs.

Example build i386:
bunzip2 -dc linux-2.4.18.tar.bz2|tar xf -
tar xzf freevms-0_0_44.tgz
cd linux
../freevms/linux/prescript
cp -p ~/.config .
make menuconfig
make dep
make bzImage

Example build um:
bunzip2 -dc linux-2.4.18.tar.bz2|tar xf -
tar xzf freevms-0_0_44.tgz
cd linux
mv /usr/include/linux /usr/include/linux.orig
mv /usr/include/asm /usr/include/asm.orig
ln -s include/linux /usr/include/linux
ln -s include/asm-i386 /usr/include/asm
../freevms/linux/prescript
patch -p1 -F 100 < ../uml-patch-2.4.18-11
../freevms/linux/prescript.uml
cp -p ~/.config .
make menuconfig ARCH=um
make dep ARCH=um
make linux ARCH=um
