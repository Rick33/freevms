So far:

Untar the linux dist in /usr/src

Have a dir in /usr/src (or a symlink) freevms.

Go to /usr/src/linux.

Do ./prescript. (Copies from working area /usr/src/freevms/linux)

Make symlinks from the 'kernel directory'/include/linux to /usr/include/linux
and the same with asm-i386 to /usr/include/asm.

Go to /usr/src/freevms and do a make.
(Sorry, got no make install yet)

Go back and make the kernel.
