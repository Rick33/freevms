So far:

Untar the linux dist in /usr/src or some other place.

Untar freevms in the same directory (or symlink from there to the real place)

Go to the linux directory.

Do ../freevms/linux/prescript. (Links from working area ../freevms/linux)

If having user mode linux, patch in now, and do ../freevms/linux/prescript.uml.
(We are based on uml-patch-2.4.18-11, use -p1 -F 100 and such)

Make symlinks from the 'kernel directory'/include/linux to /usr/include/linux
and the same with asm-i386 to /usr/include/asm.

Go to /usr/src/freevms and do a make.
(Sorry, got no make install yet)

Go back and make the kernel.
