So far:

About GCC/Distributions.
Due to use of anonymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
As old as gcc 3.4 must be used sometimes.
Gcc 4.3 might be used mostly.
No more recent flex than 2.5.4 must be used.

Also tested distributions:
Debian Sarge (gcc-3.3) and up to lenny. (Not sure of sarge anymore)
Latest Ubuntu/x86_64 tested is Hardy (LTS). Heard problems reports for newer.
	Install ncftp flex-old bzip2 binutils-dev libc6-dev libelfg0-dev libc6-pic sash bash-static doxygen
	Have loop support or module.
For x86_64:
Ubuntu dapper:
	Install also gcc-3.3 gcc-3.4 ia32-libs-dev

NOTE on kernel build:
If complaints about modversion.h, do a make update-modverfile.
Make dep in linux is broken, so you might have to do make bzImage twice.

NOTE on kernel config with VMS options:
There is only one option, CONFIG_VMS (replaces and includes CONFIG_VMS_IO/MM)
Do not boot with init=/bin/sh.

Example build i386:
tar xzf freevms-0_1_2.tgz
cd freevms
./envscript
cd ..
cd freevms386.iomm
make doxygen
make bzImage
make download-bliss
make build-bliss (run twice, for some reason first run quits with an error)
make download-linker
make build-linker
make download-grub
make build-grub
make vmsall
make telnet (32-bit only, and remember to change close to close2 in routines.b32)
make rootinstall
make image (as root)
make image-install (as root)
make image-kernel-iomm (as root)
(Then create an INET$CONFIG)
(Then do the steps in NOTE on VFS ODS2 module autobuild, or equivalents)
./dcl/src/install.sh
To make VirtualBox images, do make vbimage, make createvb
and do VBoxManage startvm FreeVMS
(You may have to edit VirtualBox.xml and remove images yourself)
Enable IO Apic

Next see the USE file (after compiling or installing bochs).

Bochs:
	Configure with at least 
	--enable-debugger --enable-ne2000 --enable-cpu-level=6 --enable-sse
	And maybe --enable-pci --enable-x86-64 --enable-sse2 remove sse
	Maybe --enable-smp

Bochs use:
	Use make image to make a floppy and disk image.
	Set bochs to boot the floppy grub image, and set
	c.img to cyl=4, heads=255, spt=63
	The make image script works on Debian stable, and may need some
	tailoring other places.

	Use make image-install to install the FreeVMS binaries to be
	found in /vms$common.
	Use make image-kernel-iomm to install the kernel.

Qemu use:
        qemu -fda diskimage/a.img -hda diskimage/c.img -boot a -monitor stdio

Virtualbox use:
	Just use it with both a and c images.
	Barely tested with one CPU, will do more.

NOTE on VFS ODS2 module autobuild:
Use lenny (stable), sarge may still work if lucky.
Install module-assistant and debhelper.
Do dpkg -i ods2-source_0.9.3.w7_all.deb. (Check current version)
Do m-a prepare, m-a update, m-a get ods2, m-a a-i ods2.
Run the following after you have got a working system on ext2:
dcl/src/install.sh
