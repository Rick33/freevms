So far:

About GCC/Distributions.
Due to use of anonymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
Current gcc used is at 3.3/3.4.
As recent gcc as 3.4 can now be used. (But some new problems are there)
Gcc 4.0 might be too early.
No more recent flex than 2.5.4 must be used.

NOTE on kernel build:
If complaints about modversion.h, do a make update-modverfile.
Make dep in linux is broken, so you might have to do make bzImage twice.

NOTE on kernel config with VMS options:
There is only one option, CONFIG_VMS (replaces and includes CONFIG_VMS_IO/MM)
Warning: It might be a risky destructive option. FS write may be destructive.
VMS IO works so far only on blockdevices, and the only blockdevices supported
is the uml "harddisk" and on i386 only ide.
Boot with init=/bin/sh or init=/vms\$common/sysexe/dcl

Example build i386:
tar xzf freevms-0_1_2.tgz
cd freevms
./envscript
cd ..
cd freevms386.iomm
make bzImage
make download-bliss
make build-bliss
make download-linker
make build-linker
make download-grub
make build-grub
make vmsall
make rootinstall
make image
make image-install
make image-kernel-iomm

Bochs:
	Configure with at least 
	--enable-debugger --enable-ne2000 --enable-cpu-level=6
	maybe also with --enable-sse

Bochs use:
	Use make image to make a floppy and disk image.
	Set bochs to boot the floppy grub image, and set
	c.img to cyl=4, heads=255, spt=63
	The make image script works on RedHat 9, and may need some
	tailoring other places.

	Use make image-install to install the FreeVMS binaries to be
	found in /vms$common.
	Use make image-kernel-iomm and image-kernel-noiomm to install
	the CONFIG_VMS and non-CONFIG_VMS kernels, respectively.

Bochsrc FreeVMS-related config:
	floppya: 1_44=a.img, status=inserted
	diskc: file="c.img", cyl=8, heads=255, spt=63
	boot: a
	ne2k: ioaddr=0x280, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=linux, ethdev=eth0 (on c.img, on c2.img it must be different) 

	ips: must be properly set to work. test yourself.
