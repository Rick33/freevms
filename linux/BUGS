doing something like ctrl-c in a shell gotten by ssh-ing locks the machine. (seems to be gone. wonder why.)

smp is probably broken.
highmem too.

bochs and uml works only partially, i.e. qio1 has problems.

GCC:
Due to use of anynymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
Redhat 7.2 with gcc "2.96" works. There are anonymous structure offset bugs
that has been coded around.
Redhat 8.0 with gcc 3.2 (RedHat patched) works. The anonymous structure offset
bugs present in pure gcc 3.0.1 was gone in pure 3.1.
