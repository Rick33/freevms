GCC bugs/features:
Due to use of anynymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
Redhat 7.2 with gcc "2.96" works. There are anonymous structure offset bugs
that has been coded around.
Redhat 8.0 with gcc 3.2 (RedHat patched) works. The anonymous structure offset
bugs present in pure gcc 3.0.1 was gone in pure 3.1.
There are still problems related to anonymous structure initialization.

Our bugs/features:
