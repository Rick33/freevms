GCC bugs/features:
Due to use of anynymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
Redhat 7.2 with gcc "2.96" works. There are anonymous structure offset bugs
that has been coded around.
Redhat 8.0 with gcc 3.2 (RedHat patched) works. The anonymous structure offset
bugs present in pure gcc 3.0.1 was gone in pure 3.1.
There are still problems related to anonymous structure initialization.

Our bugs/features:
See also TODO.

Generally:
No smp support (is probably broken).
No highmem support.
Do not expect decnet to work for the moment, it may collide with something else.
Threads are probably broke.
With gcc 3.4.x, search_exception_table can not find __init functions (test_wp_bi).
Still scheduling bugs left (gives panic ctl$gl_pcb on comq).
P1PP corruption; dual allocation and gets overwritten.
Copy on RMS on ODS-2 does not work properly.
Uml gets often tracing myself.
Uml for the moment is broken.
ASTs to user space crashes UML, usually.
Asts not working due to use of exe$ instead of sys$

For non-CONFIG_VMS:
Init crashes with keventd after rc.sysinit has finished.
Cluster networking on a real PC hangs one of them.
Creprc has some output problems.
Process sessions has some problems.
The 60 sec limit and one login only for loginout. (panics). (not anymore).
Ods-2 may get problems with directory file > 1.
Logicals only can be used with show logical, define and create /name_table;
nowhere else yet. (And only without nesting.)

For CONFIG_VMS:
RMS $get does not work in IPACP CNF$Configure_ACP.
With ext2 copy there are some fs problems. (See fsck)
With ext2 truncate is broke/not implemented.
You may now get panics with the new console driver.
The pseudo and console drivers may not always work properly.
There are console driver problems with sh, use DCL.
It bugs and loops with ast in ast.
Telnet may not work for long.
Telnet gets problems with the first input line.
Telnet used with lib$put_output may bug the terminal i/o-system.
RMS parse/do_parse not quite according to spec (manual), since open can
not reset parse state.
RMS dir can not be done on ext2 root /.
/bin/sh and other shellscripting does not work.
