GCC bugs/features:
Due to use of anynymous structures a more recent gcc is needed.
Redhat 7.2 with gcc "2.96" works. There are anonymous structure offset bugs
that has been coded around.
Redhat 8.0 with gcc 3.2 (RedHat patched) works. The anonymous structure offset
bugs present in pure gcc 3.0.1 was gone in pure 3.1.
There are still problems related to anonymous structure initialization.

Our bugs/features:
See also TODO.

Generally:
No smp support (is probably broken).
No highmem support.

Threads are probably broke.

Still scheduling bugs left (gives panic ctl$gl_pcb on comq).

Uml gets often tracing myself.
Uml for the moment is broken.

You may now get panics with the new console driver.
The pseudo and console drivers may not always work properly.
