A sort of very short summary of points to remember from the mailing list.


Linux was chosen over mach, hurd, freebsd etc because of availability.
PC for the same reason.

"Goal": VMS 5.x/32 bit, because that's the newest Internals books.

"VMB/SRM" bootloader is based on Grub.

No new interrupts aside from 0x81 can be implemented yet because of softirqs.

PAL: do CPU stuff like queues, ipls, asts etc in software. (Borrow from FreeBSD?)

Find out how to implement system calls/services with more than 6 params.

Will also have to do some preparations for clustering and 64-bits.

In i/o services you will want to ensure that layering is possible, a la
unix streams if convenient (no need really to duplicate the detailed
VMS driver structures if you can use existing ones). Many VMS facilities
can be done more cleanly with such layering than DEC ever did them
with special purpose code all over the place.
Meaning having DKDRIVER as layer, and not putting every driver in it?
