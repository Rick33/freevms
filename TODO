(with the risk of things here being outdated)

Let RMS also use Ext2 with write support.
Execute programs with execve and imgact on Ods-2.
Get more/better write-support in.
Do more SCA/SCS stuff.
At least look at whatever "device" uml uses and NE2000.

FIX pal
better RMS compatibilty; check input and output RAB fields (incl l_sts)

Logical support in the DCL and elsewhere

Rewrite ide driver or make it use VMS data structures.

Put RMS ifab/irab in P1.

Fix CONFIG_VMS network drivers.

Gcc 3.4.x compile

Use 2 other cpu modes.

Put ctl$gl_ccb_table in P1.

Use correct interface to network module in CONFIG_VMS

Make a make linker autobuild

Use sys$ with system service call instead in exe$ in ipacp etc, to make asts etc function properly.

Schedule code cleanup.

More P1 space.
Will do more with the IP stuff.
Might move clustering to just CONFIG_VMS mode, and go from socket to QIO.

Let RMS also use Ext2 with write support.
Execute programs with execve and imgact on Ods-2.
Get more/better write-support in.
Do more SCA/SCS stuff.
After some time even more driver support might be cut/broke (the most).
