TODO:
(With the risk of things here being outdated)


Misc:
Check use of relative queues; is fork use of & correct?
Check waitall and wait
sysimgact use PAGE_ instead of numbers.
Look at having images as ELF? (Itanic is going to use ELF, it seems)
Make a make linker autobuild
Use sys$ with system service call instead in exe$ in ipacp etc, to make asts etc function properly. (Note: doing that in vmsbuffer.c was unstable)
Try to upgrade 2.4.18 uml part from 11 to the newest
Use real interrupts instead of calls for sch$reshed iofork etc
Use setpsli even in more interrupts/exceptions?
Look at how simple and complex buffers are allocated and freed
Update FCB at the same time as read/write attrib?
Have dcltables compiled and loaded the same way as .exe2

CPU/PAL:
FIX pal
Use 2 other cpu modes.

Scheduling:
Schedule code cleanup.
Proper deletion of dead processes in the databases (still shows up with sh sys)
Make pcb$t_lname counted string

Memory management:
Check page alignment for allocated pools.
Remove panic in vmsmprotect for not implemented stuff (and implement it)
Rde with 0 start 0 len?
Fix pool to conform more with newer versions
Check global pages paging, creating and deleting.
Put RMS ifab/irab in P1.
Put ctl$gl_ccb_table in P1.
More P1 space.

Input/output:
Make echoing work in putnextchar (right before reqcom)
Check whether ddb$t_name has len first
Use correct interface to network module in CONFIG_VMS (promiscuous mode (NMA$C_PCLI_PRM) needs protocol, but that mode is not yet implemented).
Look at how ne2000 is probed
Rewrite ide driver or make it use VMS data structures.
Fix CONFIG_VMS network drivers.
For ide disk set ucb$l_maxblock and more, like in file.c
After some time even more driver support might be cut/broke (the most).

Logical names:
Logical support in the DCL and elsewhere
In syslnm trnlnm only use retlenaddr and not buflen for it.

File system:
Let RMS also use Ext2 with write support.
Execute programs with execve and imgact on Ods-2.
Get more/better write-support in.
Make import (export) handle text/binary files differently (by param).
Check if all ~1 in direct.c need +1 (and name[1])
Ext2 3rd level sizes
Better RMS compatibilty; check input and output RAB fields (incl l_sts)

Clustering:
Do MSCP protocol a bit more properly
Do more SCA/SCS stuff.
Get getdx to add 2?
Might move clustering to just CONFIG_VMS mode, and go from socket to QIO.

Networking:
For CMUIP: do checks upon parts with // check // not yet // was. more such?
Also CMUIP: there was something in telnet that should be lookup upon
And: Find the latest patch to it.
Check parenthesis and bools in CMUIP and other places.
Some forgotten // check in tcp_telnet*?
Also some #if 0 that should later be removed.
Find the newest cmuip patches
Check all local big strings, like DESC$STR_ALLOC 1000 etc. replace?
Will do more with the IP stuff.

Compiling:
Gcc 3.4.x compile
Check for more of the following in cmuip code (and more):
signed long vtcb_ptr[0]; and replace with like: long * vtcb_ptr;
Gcc 3.4 had problems with the first.
