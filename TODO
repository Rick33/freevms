(with the risk of things here being outdated)

Let RMS also use Ext2 with write support.
Execute programs with execve and imgact on Ods-2.
Get more/better write-support in.
Do more SCA/SCS stuff.
At least look at whatever "device" uml uses and NE2000.

FIX pal
better RMS compatibilty; check input and output RAB fields (incl l_sts)

Logical support in the DCL and elsewhere
