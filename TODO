(with the risk of things here being outdated)

Let RMS also use Ext2 with write support.
Execute programs with execve and imgact on Ods-2.
Get more/better write-support in.
Do more SCA/SCS stuff.
At least look at whatever "device" uml uses and NE2000.

FIX pal
better RMS compatibilty; check input and output RAB fields (incl l_sts)

Logical support in the DCL and elsewhere

Rewrite ide driver or make it use VMS data structures.

Put RMS ifab/irab in P1.

Fix CONFIG_VMS network drivers.

Gcc 3.4.x compile

Use 2 other cpu modes.

Put ctl$gl_ccb_table in P1.

Use correct interface to network module in CONFIG_VMS (promiscuous mode (NMA$C_PCLI_PRM) needs protocol, but that mode is not yet implemented).

Make a make linker autobuild

Use sys$ with system service call instead in exe$ in ipacp etc, to make asts etc function properly. (Note: doing that in vmsbuffer.c was unstable)

Schedule code cleanup.

More P1 space.
Will do more with the IP stuff.
Might move clustering to just CONFIG_VMS mode, and go from socket to QIO.

Let RMS also use Ext2 with write support.
Execute programs with execve and imgact on Ods-2.
Get more/better write-support in.
Do more SCA/SCS stuff.
After some time even more driver support might be cut/broke (the most).

Try to upgrade 2.4.18 uml part from 11 to the newest

For CMUIP: do checks upon parts with // check // not yet // was. more such?
Also CMUIP: there was something in telnet that should be lookup upon
And: Find the latest patch to it.

Check parenthesis and bools in CMUIP and other places.

Use real interrupts instead of calls for sch$reshed iofork etc

Some forgotten // check in tcp_telnet*?
Also some #if 0 that should later be removed.

check whether ddb$t_name has len first
make pcb$t_lname counted string

check all local big strings, like DESC$STR_ALLOC 1000 etc. replace?

Find the newest cmuip patches

use setpsli even in more interrupts/exceptions?

Look at how ne2000 is probed

Look at how simple and complex buffers are allocated and freed

Make echoing work in putnextchar (right before reqcom)

In syslnm trnlnm only use retlenaddr and not buflen for it.

Check for more of the following in cmuip code (and more):
signed long vtcb_ptr[0]; and replace with like: long * vtcb_ptr;
Gcc 3.4 had problems with the first.

sysimgact use PAGE_ instead of numbers.

Look at having images as ELF? (Itanic is going to use ELF, it seems)

Check waitall and wait

Rename librtl/src/starlet.a to librtl.a

Get getdx to add 2?

Proper deletion of dead processes in the databases (still shows up with sh sys)

Do mscp protocol a bit more properly

Check global pages paging, creating and deleting.

Rde with 0 start 0 len?
