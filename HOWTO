So far:

About GCC/Distributions.
Only Debian 6 and 7 is tested/supported.
Only gcc-4.4.5 and 4.7.2 is tested/supported.
No more recent flex than 2.5.4 must be used (for Bliss).

CPU status:
I386: some instability.
X86_64: some more instability.

Install build-essential wget ncftp flex-old bzip2 binutils-dev libc6-dev libelfg0-dev libc6-pic sash bash-static doxygen dejagnu bison.

There are no config options.

Example build i386:
git clone git@github.com:/rroart/freevms.git (or pull)
cd freevms
./envscript
cd ..
cd freevms386.iomm
make doxygen
make bzImage
make vmsall
make rootinstall
make image (as root)
make image-install (as root)
make image-kernel-iomm (as root)

Not to be done currently:
make download-linker
make build-linker (for the time being, due to info loss (R_X86_64_GOTTPOFF))
make download-grub
make build-grub (for the time being, use a premade a.img instead)
(Create an INET$CONFIG)
(Then do the steps in NOTE on VFS ODS2 module autobuild, or equivalents)
./dcl/src/install.sh

Not to be done anymore:
make download-bliss
make build-bliss (run twice, for some reason first run quits with an error)
make telnet (32-bit only, and remember to change close to close2 in routines.b32)

Next see the USE file (after compiling or installing bochs).

Note that only the two first entries are bootable.

Bochs:
	Configure with at least 
	--enable-debugger --enable-ne2000 --enable-cpu-level=6 --enable-sse
	And maybe --enable-pci --enable-x86-64 --enable-sse2 remove sse
	Maybe --enable-smp

Bochs use:
	Use make image to make a floppy and disk image.
	Set bochs to boot the floppy grub image, and set
	c.img to cyl=4, heads=255, spt=63
	The make image script works on Debian stable, and may need some
	tailoring other places.

	Use make image-install to install the FreeVMS binaries to be
	found in /vms$common.
	Use make image-kernel-iomm to install the kernel.

Qemu use:
        qemu -fda diskimage/a.img -hda diskimage/c.img -boot a -monitor stdio -net none

Virtualbox info:
	   To make VirtualBox images, do make vbimage, make createvb
	   and do VBoxManage startvm FreeVMS
	   (You may have to edit VirtualBox.xml and remove images yourself)
	   Enable IO Apic

Virtualbox use:
	Just use it with both a and c images.
	Barely tested with one CPU, will do more.

NOTE on VFS ODS2 module autobuild:
Use lenny (stable), sarge may still work if lucky.
Install module-assistant and debhelper.
Do dpkg -i ods2-source_0.9.3.w7_all.deb. (Check current version)
Do m-a prepare, m-a update, m-a get ods2, m-a a-i ods2.
Run the following after you have got a working system on ext2:
dcl/src/install.sh
