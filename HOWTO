So far:

About GCC/Distributions.
Only Debian 6 and 7 is tested/supported.
Only gcc-4.4.5 and 4.7.2 is tested/supported.
No more recent flex than 2.5.4 must be used (for Bliss).

CPU status:
I386: some instability.
X86_64: some more instability.

Install build-essential wget ncftp flex-old bzip2 binutils-dev libc6-dev libelfg0-dev libc6-pic sash bash-static doxygen dejagnu bison.

There are no config options.

Example build i386:
git clone git@github.com:/rroart/freevms.git (or pull)
cd freevms
./envscript
cd ..
cd freevms386.iomm
make doxygen
make bzImage
make vmsall
make rootinstall
make image (as root)
make image-install (as root)
make image-kernel-iomm (as root)

Not to be done currently:
make download-linker
make build-linker (for the time being, due to info loss (R_X86_64_GOTTPOFF))
make download-grub
make build-grub (for the time being, use a premade a.img instead)
(Create an INET$CONFIG)
(Then do the steps in NOTE on VFS ODS2 module autobuild, or equivalents)
./dcl/src/install.sh

Not to be done anymore:
make download-bliss
make build-bliss (run twice, for some reason first run quits with an error)
make telnet (32-bit only, and remember to change close to close2 in routines.b32)

Next see the USE file (after compiling or installing bochs).

Note that only the two first entries are bootable.

Qemu use:
        qemu -fda diskimage/a.img -hda diskimage/c.img -boot a -monitor stdio -net none

NOTE on VFS ODS2 module autobuild:
Use lenny (stable), sarge may still work if lucky.
Install module-assistant and debhelper.
Do dpkg -i ods2-source_0.9.3.w7_all.deb. (Check current version)
Do m-a prepare, m-a update, m-a get ods2, m-a a-i ods2.
Run the following after you have got a working system on ext2:
dcl/src/install.sh

Networking:

Run qemu with ne2k.

CMUIP:
	Skip this if you just downloaded and tried the image.
	see example file INET$CONFIG.
